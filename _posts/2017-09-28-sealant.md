This paper presents SEALANT, a novel tool that combines static analysis and visualization techniques that, together, enable accurate iden- tification of inter-app vulnerabilities as well as their systematic visualization. SEALANT statically analyzes architectural information of a given set of apps, infers vulnerable communication channels where inter-app attacks can be launched, and visualizes the identified information in a compositional representation. SEALANT has been demonstrated to accurately identify inter- app vulnerabilities from hundreds of real-world Android apps and to effectively deliver the identified information to users.
