In this paper, we take a step toward addressing that scarcity by using the information in the issue and code repositories of open-source software systems to investigate the cause and frequency of such architectural design decisions. Furthermore, building on these results, we develop a predictive model that is able to identify the architectural signi cance of newly submitted issues, thereby helping engineers to prevent the adverse effects of architectural decay. The results of this study are based on the analysis of 21,062 issues affecting 301 versions of 5 large open-source systems for which the code changes and issues were publicly accessible.
