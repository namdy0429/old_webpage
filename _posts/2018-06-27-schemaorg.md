Jointly launched in mid-2011 by major search engines like Google and Bing, Schema.org is designed to facilitate structured and knowledge graphâ€“centric search applications on the
Web. The Web Data Commons project has crawled increasing amounts of Schema.org data in recent years, providing a golden opportunity for socio-technological data studies
that consider the semantics of content. The authors present empirical studies of organizations in three economic sectors that expose semantically linked Schema.org annotations.
