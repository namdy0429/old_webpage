This paper introduces SCUTUM, a novel technique that automatically detects vulnerable event communication channels from event-based systems by combining static flow analysis and pattern matching. SCUTUMâ€™s evaluation demonstrated that it identifies vulnerable event communication channels with higher accuracy than existing techniques from 28 real-world apps and it is applicable to the apps comprising a number of components.
